ID number represents what multiple it leaves to the airport (bus number 7 leaves on multiples of 7; 7, 14, 21, 28, etc.). Bus schedules are defined based on a timestamp that measures the number of minutes since some fixed reference point in the past.

**Figure out the earliest bus you can take to the airport.** (There will be exactly one such bus.)

What is the ID of the earliest bus you can take to the airport multiplied by the number of minutes you'll need to wait for that bus?
