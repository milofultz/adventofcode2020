    <p
      >After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a
      vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go
      on without you.</p
    >

    <p
      >The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The
      gold coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just
      call them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of
      them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time
      you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.</p
    >

    <p
      >To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December
      25th.</p
    >

    <p
      >Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on
      each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
      complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!</p
    >

    <p
      >Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your
      expense report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite
      adding up.</p
    >

    <p
      >Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and
      then multiply those two numbers together.</p
    >

    <p>For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:</p>

    <pre class="center-text">
1721
979
366
299
675
1456</pre
    >

    <p
      >In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299.
      Multiplying them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct
      answer is 514579.</p
    >

    <p
      >Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that
      sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?</p
    >

    <h2 class="center-text">Part Two</h2>

    <p
      >The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even
      offers you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They
      offer you a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense
      report that meet the same criteria.</p
    >

    <p
      >Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are
      979, 366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer,
      241861950.</p
    >

    <p
      >In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum
      to 2020?</p
